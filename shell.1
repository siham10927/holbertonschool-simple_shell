NAME
       hsh - a simple UNIX command interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       hsh

DESCRIPTION
       hsh is a simple UNIX command interpreter that mimics some of the basic functionalities of the sh shell. It can be
       run in interactive mode or non-interactive mode.

       In interactive mode, hsh displays a prompt and waits for the user to enter a command. The prompt is displayed again
       after each command is executed. Commands are simple and consist of a single word.

       In non-interactive mode, hsh reads commands from standard input and executes them.

OPTIONS
       None

EXIT STATUS
       0      If the command is successfully executed.

       1      If an error occurs while executing the command.

       2      If the command is not found.

EXAMPLES
       To run hsh in interactive mode:

           $ hsh
           $ /bin/ls
           $ exit

       To run hsh in non-interactive mode:

           $ echo "/bin/ls" | hsh
